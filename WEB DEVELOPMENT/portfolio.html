                    A passionate individual with a background in Geomatics Engineering and Geospatial Information Sustems.
                    I am a student at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology with a strong foundation in Surveying, Geographic Information System(GIS),
                    Remote Sensing, Photogrammetry and Spatial data analysis. Currently, I am honing my skills further as a software development 
                    student at the Power Learn Project (PLP) Academy, delving further into the world of coding and  Technology.

                <p>                
                    I am a multifaceted expert in geospatial technology, with a passion for innovation and excellence. As a master 
                    of Google Earth Engine, I leverage its cloud-based capabilities to tackle environmental challenges and facilitate 
                    data-driven decision-making. My proficiency in web development enables me to craft dynamic platforms that empower 
                    users to engage with geospatial data in novel ways. With extensive experience in land surveying and GIS, I specialize 
                    in spatial analysis, data visualization, and database manipulation, utilizing tools such as ArcMap and QGIS to inform 
                    strategic decision-making across diverse projects. Additionally, as a seasoned remote sensing specialist, I decode the 
                    secrets hidden within satellite and aerial imagery using ENVI, ERDAS, and more, while excelling in photogrammetry to 
                    derive precise 3D information. My expertise extends to AutoCAD Civil 3D drawing, ensuring optimal project outcomes through 
                    meticulous attention to detail. With a commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology and driving sustainable solutions, 
                    I thrive at the intersection of innovation and expertise in geospatial science and technology.
